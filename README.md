## Introduction

Welcome to the **Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG** repository! This project focuses on enhancing Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieval of relevant external knowledge before generating responses, enabling improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations. 

## Description

The **Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG** repository is dedicated to exploring techniques that augment Language Models with retrieval mechanisms. By integrating knowledge retrieval into the response generation process, models can deliver more contextually relevant and accurate responses across a variety of tasks.

## What is RAG?

**RAG** stands for Retrieval-Augmented-Generation, a methodology that combines the power of large-scale pre-trained Language Models with the capability to retrieve relevant knowledge from external sources. By utilizing retrieval mechanisms, RAG models can mitigate common issues like factual inaccuracies and generation of irrelevant or nonsensical responses.

## Key Features

🔍 **Document Retrieval**: Incorporate document retrieval into the generation process  
🧠 **Knowledge Graph**: Utilize knowledge graphs for enhanced context understanding  
💬 **Semantic Search**: Enhance search capabilities for retrieving relevant information  
📚 **Text Embedding**: Utilize vector embeddings for better representation of textual data  
💡 **Prompt Engineering**: Craft effective prompts to guide the generation process
